This program was created as an additional task on the subject of "Computer Information Protection" in 2019 in Python using the "Kivy" framework.

The main idea of this program was to implement all the encryption algorithms obtained during the training period and create an information note for all encryption methods.

The choice of the Kivy framework as a tool for creating an interface with the ability to compile python code into an executable file in the Windows environment was a fatal mistake.

After the end of the development of the application, it turned out that the kivy application compiler was not able to process some libraries that were necessary for the implementation of the project.

deadline for the project was coming to an end, it was decided to add the x32 x64 python compilers, along with the kiwi libraries, directly to the project folder, which of course increased the project's share many times over. 

Unfortunately, the github did not allow downloading all the necessary files for the program to work, so I am attaching only the code and screenshots of the program. If you want to run the application, the Python compiler with the Kiwi library must be installed on your computer.
